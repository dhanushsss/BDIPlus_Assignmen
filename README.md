# Technologies and Libraries Used

## 1. Spring Boot

**Purpose:** Spring Boot is a Java-based framework used to create standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It simplifies the setup and configuration of Spring applications, making it easier to develop robust and scalable applications.

**Role in the Project:** Spring Boot serves as the foundation of this project, providing essential features such as dependency management, auto-configuration, and embedded web server capabilities.

## 2. Spring Data JPA

**Purpose:** Spring Data JPA is part of the Spring Data project and simplifies database access using the Java Persistence API (JPA). It provides convenient methods for data repository operations.

**Role in the Project:** Spring Data JPA is used to interact with the MySQL database in this project. It handles database operations and allows easy customization of queries.

## 3. MySQL Database

**Purpose:** MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system. It is used for storing and managing structured data.

**Role in the Project:** MySQL serves as the primary data storage system for the application. It stores customer information and other relevant data.

## 4. Swagger

**Purpose:** Swagger is an open-source tool for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and testing API endpoints.

**Role in the Project:** Swagger is used to generate API documentation and provide an interactive API documentation portal. It makes it easier for developers to understand and test the available API endpoints.

## 5. JUnit

**Purpose:** JUnit is a widely used Java testing framework for unit testing. It allows the creation of test cases and the execution of tests to ensure the reliability of code.

**Role in the Project:** JUnit is used for writing and executing unit tests to verify the correctness of the application's business logic and API endpoints.

## 6. Mockito

**Purpose:** Mockito is a mocking framework that simplifies the creation of mock objects for testing. It allows the simulation of dependencies during unit testing.

**Role in the Project:** Mockito is used in conjunction with JUnit to create mock objects for testing service classes and controllers. It helps isolate components for unit testing.

## 7. Maven

**Purpose:** Maven is a build automation and project management tool for Java projects. It manages project dependencies, builds the project, and packages it for deployment.

**Role in the Project:** Maven is used for project dependency management, building, and packaging. It simplifies project configuration and ensures that all required libraries are included.

## 8. Postman

**Purpose:** Postman is a popular API testing tool that simplifies the testing and validation of RESTful APIs. It allows the creation of API requests and the examination of responses.

**Role in the Project:** Postman is used for testing the API endpoints of the project. It helps ensure that the API functions correctly and responds as expected.

## 9. HTML/CSS/JavaScript

**Purpose:** HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript are fundamental web technologies for building web pages and adding interactivity to web applications.

**Role in the Project:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript are used to create the project's web-based user interface, allowing users to interact with the application through a web browser.

## 10. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

**Purpose:** CORS is a security feature that controls web page access to resources on a different domain. It prevents potential security vulnerabilities related to cross-origin requests.

**Role in the Project:** CORS configuration is used to specify which origins are allowed to access the API. It enhances security by controlling cross-origin requests.

This documentation provides an overview of the key technologies and libraries used in your project, their purposes, and their roles in the application. You can expand this section to include additional technologies or libraries specific to your project.
